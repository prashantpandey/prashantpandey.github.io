Drop me a note if you want to do cool research, run/hike in the mountains, and enjoy the world famous skii in Salt Lake City. \nI am a Research Scientist at VMware Research. My goal as a researcher is to advance the theory and practice of resource-efficient data structures and employ them to democratize complex and large-scale data analyses. I have worked on designing and building tools for large-scale data management problems across computational biology, stream processing, and storage.\nPreviously, I did a postdoc at UC Berkeley working with Prof. Aydin Buluc and Prof. Katherine Yelick. Prior to that, I spent one year as a Postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University working with Prof. Carl Kingsford. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, and defended my dissertation, Fast and Space-Efficient Maps: Shrinking Big Data Down to Size. At Stony brook University, I was co-advised by Prof. Michael Bender and Prof. Rob Johnson. (Dissertation committee: Mike Ferdman, Rob Patro, Guy Blelloch.)\nI love outdoors and occasionally like to scribble my experience in a blog.\n","date":1643134165,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1643134165,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I will join the School of computing at the University of Utah as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2022.
